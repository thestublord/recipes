<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
  <li>4 teaspoons vegetable oil</li>
  <li>4 eggs, lightly beaten</li>
  <li>1/4 cup salsa</li>
  <!-- Add more ingredients as needed -->
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Add eggs and egg whites to the hot skillet. Cook over medium heat, without stirring, until mixture begins to set on the bottom and around the edges. With a spatula, lift and fold the partially cooked egg mixture so the uncooked portion flows underneath. Continue cooking until egg mixture is cooked through but still glossy and moist, 2 to 3 minutes. Return vegetable mixture to skillet with cheese and chiles; stir gently to combine.

  </li>
  <li>Fill each tortilla with about 1/3 cup filling; roll up as tightly as possible. Arrange taquitos, seam side down, on the prepared baking sheet, leaving space between each. Brush evenly with remaining 3 teaspoons oil.</li>
  <li>Bake in the preheated oven until evenly browned and crispy, about 15 minutes or. Serve with salsa and, if desired, toppers.p</li>
