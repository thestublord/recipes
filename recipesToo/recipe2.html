<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
    This grilled tomahawk steak recipe is a showstopper, ideal for sharing with friends and family. This reverse-seared steak is cooked to perfection with an unctuous compound butter filled with shallots, garlic, and chives. I like to use a Bluetooth-enabled meat thermometer to help me achieve the perfect medium-rare internal temperature.

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Steak Rub and Steak:</li>
  <li>1 tablespoon brown sugar</li>
  <li>2 teaspoons onion powder</li>
  <!-- Add more ingredients as needed -->
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Grill steak directly on the grates of the preheated grill; sear on both sides, about 2 minutes per side. This is a fatty piece of meat, so be mindful of flame flare-ups. The internal temperature should now read 125 to 135 degrees F (51 to 57 degrees C) for medium rare.</li>
  <li>Remove steak from the grill, and smear compound butter over top. Let butter melt into the steak, heating up the fresh garlic, shallots, and chives. Let steak rest for 10 minutes.</li>
  <li>Slice steak and serve with accumulated juices and melted butter. Be sure to serve the boneâ€“someone will want to gnaw on it!</li>
